## Getting Started
 
The best way to start learning TLA+ is with the [TLA+ Video Course](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html), which is actually very engaging. Then read the first 80 pages of the [Specifying Systems](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html?back-link=learning.html#book) book, which is somewhat less engaging, but very helpful. The official repository of [TLA+ learning material can be found here](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/learning.html). 

> _Note: there's also a language that compiles into TLA+ called PlusCal. It is slightly less powerful (and in fact you may need to use TLA+ expressions inline); however, it looks more like a programming language.[Practical TLA+](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-3829-5) is a good book if you want to learn it. I'm sure it's sufficiently powerful to work the examples on this site. AWS uses both TLA+ and PlusCal for different algorithms. However, as PlusCal compiles to TLA+, understanding TLA+ is generally considered a good idea, regardless of which one you use._

The [TLA+ Language Manual for Engineers](https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/lang/index.html) provides a semi-comprehensive guide to the TLA+ language. 

The [Learn TLA Website](https://learntla.com/introduction/) has both [TLA+](https://learntla.com/tla/) and PlusCal information. It is less comprehensive, but somewhat more accessible, than the [TLA+ Language Manual for Engineers](https://apalache.informal.systems/docs/lang/index.html).



## Advanced Concepts

### Want structured learning?
- [Specifying Systems](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html?back-link=learning.html#book): **Pages 81-227**: Advanced but well-explained examples
- [Weeks of Debugging Can Save You Hours of TLA+ (Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjsI0lTSjIo)
- [Blocking Queue](https://github.com/lemmy/BlockingQueue)
- [Using TLA+ in the Real World to Understand a Glibc Bug](https://probablydance.com/2020/10/31/using-tla-in-the-real-world-to-understand-a-glibc-bug/)

### Know what you're looking for?
- [TLA+ Examples Repository](https://github.com/tlaplus/Examples): Highly advise you read each algorithm along with a paper or explainer, to correlate concepts to code.
- [Advanced Concepts from TLA+ Website](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/advanced.html): Provide references for very specific parts of TLA+.
- [Specifying Systems](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/book.html?back-link=learning.html#book): **Pages 228-End**. Basically a reference manual.
